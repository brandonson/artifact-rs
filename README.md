#Artifact Logging Library

Artifact (or artifact-rs) is a logging library for the [rust language](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).
It aims to provide effective logging in debug builds, while allowing release builds to limit or disable
logging entirely through Cargo configuration.

##Documentation

There is currently little to no documentation about the library.  Stay tuned though, rustdocs are in
the works!

##Examples

The bin directory has at least one or more examples (depends how often I update this)

##License

Artifact (which is composed of all code within this, the artifact-rs github repository) is released under
the terms of the MIT license.
